#Coursera-Java-Programming-Solving-Problems-with-Software
It's a part of Coursera-Java-Programming-and-Software-Engineering-Fundamentals specialization.
Short review:
Previous courses in specialization:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript was nothing interesting to put here. Hence I keep all in a codepen https://codepen.io/ddk256/. Will come back to do smth about AI or Blockchain later.
Current work will be posted accordingly.
